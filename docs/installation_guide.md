# Installation Guide

## Dependencies

-  C++11 or higher compiler
- Thrust C++ library
-  Boost C++ library
- OpenMP support and CUDA compiler (optional)
- For Python bindings: Python interpreter with NumPy, Blitz++ C++ library


Conflicting versions of Boost and Thrust may cause the build to fail. If that happens, try e.g. Thrust 12.9 and Boost 1.83, with the following fix:
```bash
git clone -b Thrust_2 --depth=1 https://github.com/pdziekan/odeint.git
cp -r odeint/include/boost/numeric/odeint/* /usr/include/boost/numeric/odeint/
rm -rf odeint
```


## Installation with Apptainer/Singularity

Apptainer is a container platform designed for scientific computing.
It allows packaging the software environment â€” including dependencies into a single, portable Singularity Image File (.sif).
Instructions for installation with Apptainer are available at [the UWLCM wiki]().


## Building

```bash
git clone git@github.com:your-repo/libcloudphxx.git
cd libcloudph++
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++
make install
```

CMake options:
- Selecting the compilation mode: -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE = Release / Debug / RelWithDebInfo 
- Selecting the compiler: -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER = g++ / clang++ / ...
- Choosing a custom directory for the installation: -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX = `/usr/local`, `/home/builds`, etc.
- Pointing to the location of a dependency, for example Thrust: -DTHRUST_INCLUDE_DIR = ...
- Running the compilation in parallel for speedup: `make -jN install`, where N is the number of cores.
